* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) must be installed on your operating system.

## Installing vCard

To install **vCard**, follow the steps below based on your operating system:


1.: npm install
2.: npm install react-icons
3.: npm install lucide-react
4.: npm install framer-motion
5.: npm install @emailjs/browser


### Linux and macOS:

```bash
sudo git clone [https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio.git](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio.git)

### Key Improvements Made:
* **Hierarchical Headings:** Used `#` for the main title and `##` for sections to create a clear Table of Contents (GitHub does this automatically for these tags).
* **Code Blocks:** Wrapped the commands in triple backticks (`` ``` ``) with language identifiers (`bash`, `powershell`) for syntax highlighting and easy copying.
* **Horizontal Rules:** Added `---` to create visual separation between sections for better scannability.
* **Link Integration:** Added a link to the official Git website in the Prerequisites section to help users who don't have it yet.







Would you like me to add a **"Features"** or **"Technologies Used"** section to make the README more descriptive?
